🧠 Mental Health Appointment Management System

This is a full-stack *MERN* (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project designed to support mental health services by managing doctor-patient appointment workflows.

The system includes *two types of users*:

- 👩‍⚕ *Admin/Doctor* – Can register/login to view, accept, or cancel patient appointments and view dashboard statistics.
- 🧍 *User/Patient* – Can book an appointment by submitting a form with personal and health-related information.

> 📌 *Purpose:* This platform helps streamline the scheduling and management of mental health consultations, giving doctors real-time insight into accepted and cancelled
>  appointments while making the booking process easier for patients.
